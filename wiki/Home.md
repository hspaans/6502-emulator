# Welcome to the python-6502-emulator wiki

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a great language to learn because it is
easy to learn and safe to write in. It is also available for Windows, Linux and
Mac, and it is free. It is also available on [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
which is targeted for education and testing purposes. This makes computer
science easy accessible to everyone. Also for writing a basic emulator to learn
how computers work and what they do. The [6502](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/6502)
processor has a very simple design and a small instruction set that makes it
easy to learn.

Learning how processors work also gives the possibility to understand why
certain applications are so slow and how to optimize them, but also how to
start doing security research by writing a fuzzer to find vulnerabilities.
Let's start with the basics and write a simple 6502 emulator before we start
with the assembly language.

The [Introduction](#introduction) chapter is mainly based on the **6502
Instruction Set Guide** by [Andrew John Jacobs aka BitWise](https://github.com/andrew-jacobs)
and full credit goes to him. Sadly he passed away in 2021 and I copied his work
as a reference as his website is no longer available.
