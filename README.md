# CS: Writing a 6502 emulator in Python

[Python] is a great language to learn because it is easy to learn and safe to write in. It is also available for Windows, Linux and Mac, and it is free. It is also available on [Raspberry Pi][Raspberry Pi] which is targetted for education and testing purposes. This makes computer science easy accessible to everyone. Also for writing a basic emulator to learn how computers work and what they do. The [6502][6502] processor has a very simple design and a small instruction set that makes it easy to learn.

Learning how processors work also gives the possibility to understand why certain applications are so slow and how to optimize them, but also how to start doing security research by writing a fuzzer to find vulnerabilities. Lets start with the basics and write a simple 6502 emulator before we start with the assembly language.
